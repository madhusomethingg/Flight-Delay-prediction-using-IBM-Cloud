Over the past 20 years, air travel has grown in popularity among tourists, primarily due to its efficiency and, in some cases, comfort. The result has been a remarkable increase in land traffic and air traffic. Significant levels of aircraft delays on the ground and in the air have also been brought on by an increase in air traffic.
These delays are responsible for large economic and environmental losses. These delays not only cause inconveniences to the airlines but also to the passengers. The result is an increase in travel time which increases the expenses associated with food and lodging and ultimately causes stress among passengers. The airlines are victims of extra costs associated with their crews, aircraft repositioning, fuel consumption while trying to reduce elapsed times, and many others which together tamper their reputation and often result in a loss of demand by passengers.

Given the vast amount of data on flight travels, valuable insights can be drawn from this data to allow us to gain a better understanding of flight delays. Moreover, with the abundance in data, machine learning models can be trained to possibly predict these delays, something that may prove very valuable for individual travelers and businesses alike. Hence, the main objective of this machine learning model is to predict flight delays accurately in order to optimize flight operations and minimize the delays.
